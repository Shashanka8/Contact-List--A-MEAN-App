# Contact-List-A-MEAN-App
A simple application for Contact list using MEAN stack

Here I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4 withAngular7 for frontend part. And for backend part I used Node.js and Express framework. Also used MongoDB as database for CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation for the data.

I have used diiferent middleware using Express framework. Mongoose is used for connecting database with server.

Also implemented RESTful API web service for integration between client and server.

If you want to download and use it. Then from package.json you can find all the dependecies and you have install those dependecies in your system to use this application.
