# Contact-List-A-MEAN-App
A simple application for Contact list using MEAN stack

Here I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4 withAngular7 for frontend part. And for backend part I used Node.js and Express framework. Also used MongoDB as database for CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation for the data.

I have used diiferent middleware using Express framework. Mongoose is used for connecting database with server.

Also implemented RESTful API web service for integration between client and server.
